            <h1>Hospital</h1>
            <p>During the research and development of the Demon Core there were two fatal incidents.</p>
            <p>The first accident was caused by 
                Harry Daghlian fumbling and dropping the last reflector brick, causing the core to reach Super Critical, 
                emitting a blast of radiation. The scientist performing this experiment immediately 
                disassembled the contraption, causing himself to be blasted with further radiation. He died 25 days later of 
                Acute Radiation Syndrome, over a week longer than the estimated life expectancy for ARS of 2 weeks.

            <p>
                The second incident involving the Demon Core was due to improper safety protocol. 
                Louis Slotin, the man who was demonstrating an experiment for his successor, was not following safety 
                protocols and was using a flathead screwdriver to hold the 2 halves of the Demon Core housing apart. 
                The screwdriver then slipped and a bright flash of blue light was emitted as the core reached critical mass. 
                Slotin reportedly said after this happened "Well, that does it." He then uncovered the core so it wouldn't kill 
                anyone else in the room. He died 9 days later of Acute Radiation Syndrome as well.

            <h1>Administration/Offices</h1>
            <h2>Background on the Manhattan Project</h2>
            <p>The Manhattan Project was a response to fear that the Nazis had been developing their own atomic weapons. 
                Refugees from fascist countries in Europe had learned about the new process called Atomic Fission, 
                which is where neutrons collide with larger atoms and break them apart, 
                creating more free neutrons and more collisions. This creates large amounts of energy, and, 
                in a large enough amount, it can decimate entire cities in a single blast. This wasn't known yet, 
                but people were concerned that Germany could use this power to make a bomb.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the Nazis were developing an atomic bomb, then the Allies would be in big trouble. 
                This led to the creation of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (renamed from the Advisory Committee on Uranium which was renamed to the National Defense Research Committee). 
                When Japan attacked Pearl Harbour, the US decided it was time to join the fight, siding with the Allied Powers against Japan, Germany, Austria, Italy, and Vichy France. 
                From there, we formed alliances with Canada and Great Britain to recruit scientists to work for the OSRD.

            <h1>Barracks/Housing</h1>
            <p>
                As Los Alamos was a military facility unlike the other testing and development sites housing and barracks were required. 
                The housing included barracks and homes for the scientists and their families.
